     <p>
       Understanding the concept of "weight transfer" is the most most important element of 
       how car setups and driving technique affect the handling balance of your car. 
     </p>
     <p>
       Perhaps you already understand this, but as you increase the vertical load on a tire that increases the grip
       that tire will produce.  This is why downforce cars have more grip for example.  But we can use this concept
       to affect the balance of the car both in the way the car is setup and also your driving technique.

           </p>
       </div>
     </div>
     <p></p>
     <p>
       So first lets understand the concepts of "Lateral" (between left and right side of the car) 
       and "Longitudinal" (bteween front and back) weight transfer and then explore how we
       can control those two different weight transfers using setup and driving techniques. 
     </p>
 
     
     <h2 class="text-primary-emphasis" class="text-primary-emphasis">Longitudinal Weight Transfer</h2>
     <p>
       Longitudinal weight transfer is more straight forward than Lateral weight transfer but more on that later.
       Longitudinal weight transfer is about transfering weight between the front and rear tires of the car. 
     </p>
     <p>
       For example, since the more vertical load a tire has the more grip it has, then the more of the car's 
       existing weight can be transfered to the front of the car during corner entry the
       more steering the car will have on corner entry.   
     </p>
 
     <p>
       Likewise if you were to transfer less weight to the fron tires on corner entry then you will have less
       steering (i.e more understeer).  Finding the right amount of weight transfer to get the car balance you want
       is part setup and part driving technique.  More on that later.
     </p>
   
     <p>
       This is not saying that if  you add more physical weight to the front 
       of the car it will steer more, as that would actually cause the car to 
       steer less due to the increase in centrifugal force by adding more
       weight to the front.  This is why for example the porsche 911 with the gas tank up front will 
       have more steering as the fuel burns off the car because you are reducing the physical weight at the
     </p>
 
     <h3>How to affect longitudinal weight transfer with setups</h3>
 
     <p>
       The greater the rake in the car (<a href="#rideheight">see ride height section for more info</a>) the more weight 
       is placed on the front tires even at a static state.  But keep in mind that it is not a lot more.  If you 
       go into iRacing and put the front and rear ride heights to be the same and then look at the corner weights 
       iRacing calculates, and then compare those corner weights after you jack up the rear ride height a lot,
       you will not see much difference in the weight over the fron tires compared to rear tires between These
       two settings. So it is a small difference but none the less it is still there.
     </p>
     <p>
       Similar results if you soften the front springs and stiffen the rear springs (<a href="#springs">see springs section for more info</a>).
        You will see only a very small difference on the weight being added to the front tires and removed from the rear tires in this static
       state.
     </p>
     <p>
       Also with either of these rake or spring changes, when you brake you will be transfering slightly more 
       weight forward than before these changes.
     </p>

     <h2 class="text-primary-emphasis" class="text-primary-emphasis">Lateral Weight Transfer</h2>
     
     <p>
       Lateral weight transfer is the transfer of your cars existing weight between the left side tires and the right
       side tires.  As you turn a corner the inside tires will have less vertical load reducing their grip and the
       outside tires will have more vertical load increasing their grip.  i.e the weight is transfered from the inside
       to the outside tires.  But there is an very important detail about this that when you understand it will 
       help you greatly with fine tuning the balance of your car.  So lets get into it.
     </p>
     <h3>But how does lateral weight transfer affect the balance of your car?</h3>
     <p>
       The important thing to remember about lateral weight transfer is,
       the greater the difference in load between the inside tire and the outside tire 
       (i.e. more lateral weight transfer), the less overall lateral grip the
       car will have.
     </p>
 
     <p>
       The reason for this is that as we increase the load on the tire by "X" amount, we don't get the
       same "X" amount increase in lateral grip.  The curved line on the "Tire Performance Curve" shows
       that as you increase the vertical load on a tire by 100 units, the tire does
       not produce the same incremental 100 units of lateral grip.
     </p>
    
     <div class="h-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center">
       <img class="img-fluid"  src="./img/tireperformancecurve_transparent.png" />
       </div>
    
     <p>
       So this means you can affect the balance of the car by having different amounts of weight transfer
       across the front tires than the weight transfer across the rear tires.  Specifically end of the car that has more weight
       transfer from the inside to the outside tire will have less grip than the other end of the car.
     </p>
  
     <div class="card">
         <div class="card-body">
           <h5 class="card-title">Key Takeaway</h5>
        
             <p class="card-text">
                 As a car transfers weight from the inside tire to the outside tire during cornering the overal lateral grip decreases 
                 because the inside tire loose more grip than the outside tire gains in grip.  The greater the lateral weight transfer the less
                 lateral grip is generated
             <p>
             <p>
               This means that by having more lateral weight transfer at one end of the car, that end of the car will have less grip, 
               thus affecting the balance of the car

             <h4>Example of equal lateral weight transfer both front and rear</h4>
             <p> To further help you understand this, I used the numbers in the tire performance curve shown above
               and did the math as shown in the table below.  
               
               These calculations show that if we assume are turning left, 
               the car has 50/50 front to rear weight distribution, weighs 2000 units 
               and assumes the front and rear tires transfer the same amount of weight from the inside tire to the out side tire.
               In this example I assume the lateral weight transfer for both front and rear tires transfers 500 units of vertical load
               from the inside tires to the outside tire. 
               
               The overall lateral grip is reduced
               from 1042 units to 925 units (300 for inside tire and 625 for the outside tire), for both the front and the rear.
               this shows how lateral weight transfer will reduce lateral grip, and this can be leveraged to affect the balance of the car as explained below.

             <p>
         
               By controlling how the amount lateral weight transfer at the front of the car versus the rear of the car or at least how fast this weight transfer
               happens then we can affect the balance of the car.  For example, 
               if you are able to get the car to transfer less lateral load at the front tires (200 units in this example) than the rear tires (500 units in this example)
               this will give the front tires more lateral grip (1034 units) than the rear tires (925 units), as 
               shown in the calculations below, causing the car to have more steering during this left hand corner.

     <h2 class="text-primary-emphasis" class="text-primary-emphasis">Controlling lateral weight transfer through setups</h2>
     
     <p>
       All of the above information is interesting only if we can affect the amount of lateral weight transfer.
       So lets look at how we can do that.
     </p>
 
     <p>
       Lateral weight transfer is a function of the weight of the car,
       the lateral force, the location of the center of gravity and the
       track width, as shown in the following formula. 
     </p>
     <p class="text-primary-emphasis ">
     <em>Lateral Weight Transfer = (CarWeight x Lateral g's x CGHeight)/ Gravity x TrackWidth</em>
     </p>
     <p>
       We can simplify this equation, by assuming a lateral g of 1.0 which is equal to gravity
       so the formula is now...
     </p>
     <p class="text-primary-emphasis ">
       <em>LWT = (CarWeight x CGHeight)/ TrackWidth</em>
     </p>
     <p> For example :<p>
       <em class="text-primary-emphasis ">LWT = (1500 Weight Units x 20 Distance Units) / 185 Distance Units = 162 Weight Units</em> of total lateral weight transfer assuming the car
       weights 1500 Weight Units and the CG is at 20 Distance Units above ground.
     </p>
     <p> If we lower the CG 2 Distance Units<p>
       <em class="text-primary-emphasis">LWT = (1500 Weight Units x 18 Distance Units) / 185 Distance Units = 145  Weight Units</em> of total lateral weight transfer.
     </p>
  
 
     <p></p>
     <div class="card">
         <div class="card-body">
           <h5 class="card-title">Key Takeaway</h5>
 
             <p class="card-text">
                     This means that <em>raising the CG will provide more lateral weight transfer and thus less lateral grip</em>,
                     while lowering the CG will provide less lateral weight transfer and thus more lateral grip.
             </p>
               
             <p class="card-text">So we can use the front and rear ride height of the car to raise or lower the CG, which affects lateral weight transfer and thus lateral grip.
                       For example if we raise the rear ride height this raises the cg of the car at the rear more than the front which increases the lateral weight transfer 
                       at the rear, which reduces the grip the tires can generate at the rear. 
             </p>
             <p class="card-text">
               Also keep in mind that the lower the ride height in general the lower the CG so you will want to run the 
               lowest rideheight you can both front and rear while still maintaining the balance you want and not bottoming
               out the suspension.

             <h4>Side note on track width even if this is not something we can change in iRacing</h4>
             <p>
               If you do the math, you will also see that <em>making the track width wider,
               will reduce the weight transfer.</em>  For example if we widen the track width
               to 190 Distance Units the LWT will be 142 Weight Units assuming an 18 Distance Units CG.  
               So if you run the track width narrower in the rear, you will have more lateral weight transfer 
               in the rear giving you more steering.  
               Unfortunately adjusting track width in iRacing is not an adjustment we can make.
             </p>
             <p>
               Keeping in mind that <em>reducing the lateral weight transfer will give you more lateral grip,
               you will want to keep the CG as low as possible and the track width as wide as possible</em>,
               to produce the most lateral grip.

               You can also see from this that by <em>having a different
               CG, car weight and/or track width at the front of the car versus the rear of the car, you can control
               the grip level at the front and rear and thus the balance of the car.</em>  For example, if you move
               weight to the rear of the car, the rear will have more lateral weight transfer giving you more steering.

     <h3>Swaybars affect on Lateral Weight Transfer</h3>	
     <p>	
 
       So you may have been told that stiffer swaybars at the front of the car will reduce understeer, but you never
       understood why, and infact it always felt counter intuitive to you because, well race cars have stiff swaybars 
       compared to road cars so stiff swaybars must produce more grip right?  Let me try to explain this to you and also
       explain why race cars have stiff swaybars.
     </p>
     <p>
       As you stiffen swaybars, you might conclude that it  reduce the lateral weight
       transfer due to less body roll.  However because the swaybar is designed to push up on the inside tire and down on the outside
       tire swaybar actually increases the difference in vertical load between the inside and outside tire, which 
       will decrease the lateral grip.  
     </p>
 
     <div class="card">
       <div class="card-body">
         <h5 class="card-title">Key Takeaway</h5>
 
           <p class="card-text">
             A stiffer swaybar increases lateral weight transfer to that end of the car, which takes away lateral
             grip from that end of the car.  
           </p>
         
       </div>
     </div>
     <p></p>
     <p>
       So why then do race cars have stiff swaybars.  They do this to allow for quick direction changes and and to have
       a more consistent handling because it reduces the overall movement of the car.  
     </p>
     
     <div class="card">
       <div class="card-body">
         <h5 class="card-title">Sometimes you get opposite results</h5>
         <p class="card-text">
           Let me use an example of how you can get an opposite result from what I explained above.  Lets assume you
           are at Road America and going through the kink in the Porsche 911 GT3R, and the car is getting too loose for you.
           Lets assume also that you are running a low wing so you have a low rear ride height (ie. less rake) to keep 
           the car stable 
           (see the <a href="#rideheight"> Ride Height section</a> 
           for more on how lower rear ride height makes the car more stable).   
           So you think hey I need to soften the rear swaybar to reduce the lateral weight transfer in the rear so
           the rear has more grip.  Go try it,...and you will likely find that if you soften the rear arb too much the 
           rear of the car gets more loose.  At this point you have lost all faith in what I am explaining here right ? :)
     
           Well with setups you can never just isolate things, as a setup is the sum of it's parts.  In this scenario by
           allowing the rear to roll too much you are loosing aero grip in the rear because the rear outside gets too low
           and falls out of the optimal ride height range to maximize aero grip.
         </p>

     <h3>Roll Center affect on Lateral Weight Transfer</h3>
     
     <p>
       Not many cars in iRacing allow you to control the Roll Center, but the V8 Supercars are one of them that does.
       Roll Center affect on lateral weight transfer to be honest is a very complicated and somewhat contradictory
       thing.  The reason for this is that both a high RC and a low RC contribute to increasing the lateral weight
       transfer for different reasons and it is very complex to figure out which approach transfers more lateral
       weight than the other.  
     </p>
     <p> The high RC increases lateral weight transfer to the outside tire because of it's
       tendency to resist the roll.  In contrast the lower RC does not resist the roll as much, so you might think that
       it transfers less lateral weight transfer, but you need to consider the fact that as the car rolls intuitively
       this transfers more weight to the outside tires.  
     </p>
 
     <p> 
         In the research I did, the additional weight transfer
       due to roll was dismissed in the lateral weight transfer calculations as insignificant, 
       because in race cars that don't roll
       much anyway, it was said that the roll contributes less than 3% to the lateral weight transfer.  This suggests
       that if you car is not rolling much due to other settings like swaybars etc, the lower the roll center the
       more lateral grip you will have because the lateral weight transfer will be less.  However with softer suspensions
       and swaybars, you may find that a higher roll center will produce more lateral grip.
     </p>
   
       
 
   <h2 class="text-primary-emphasis">Driving Technique and how it affects Weight transfer and thus balance</h2>
 
   <p>
     So far we have talked about how setups can affect weight transfer, so now lets discuss how your driving
     technique can be used to exploit weight transfer to get the balance you want.
   </p>
   <p>
     For example, as you are braking you are transfering weight that was on the rear tires to the front tires, giving
     the front tires more relative grip than the rear tires, assuming you are not locking tires up.
 
     If you do lets say lock the front tires up or get into the abs on the front tires (micro locking) then you are not
     maximizing the grip to the front tires because firstly they are sliding too much which means they are not griping
     to their full potential, and because of this you can't transfer as much weight to the front tires further reducing
     the grip the front tires have.  This is why if you trail brake too hard into the entry of a corner your car will push,
     and if you don't brake enough your car will push.  There is a sweet spot to be found that optimizes the amount
     of front grip to achieve the balance in the car you desire all from trail braking.

          <h5 class="card-title">So lets summarize</h5>
            <p class="card-text">
             <ul>
               <li>Weight transfer is longitudinal and lateral and both affect car balance</li>
               <li>Using laterial weight transfer to loosen the car means you need more lateral weight transfer across
                 the rear tires relative to the front tires.  This can be done by stiffening the rear 
                 swaybar (or softening the front swaybar) or raising the rear ride height (i.e more rake).  
               </li>
               <li>Using lateral weight transfer to make the car push more, you need more lateral weight transfer 
                 across the front tires relative to the rear. This can be done by stiffening the the front 
                 sway bar (or softening the rear swaybar), or lowering the rear ride height.
               </li>
               <li>Using Longitudinal weight transfer to loosen the car means transfering more weight to the front
                 tires during trail braking/cornering.  This can be done by finding the optimal trail braking so you maximize the 
                 weight transfer without locking up the tires or using ABS. You can also increase the rear ride height
                 (i.e. increase the rake) or soften the front springs or stiffen the rear springs to gain slightly
                 more weight transfer forward. The front springs have a bigger impact on trail braking and the rear springs
                 have bigger impact on corner exit acceleration.
               </li>
               <li>Using Longitudinal weight transfer to make the car push more, means transfering less weight to the front
                 tires during braking/cornering.  This can be done by braking too much causing the fronts to lock or get
                 into ABS or by braking less to reduce the weight transfer. You can also decrease the rear ride height
                 (i.e. decrease the rake) or stiffen the front springs or soften the rear springs to gain slightly
                 more weight transfer forward. The front springs have a bigger impact on trail braking and the rear springs
                 have bigger impact on corner exit acceleration.

     <a href="#">back to top</a>
     <h1 class="text-warning">Camber</h1>
     <p>Camber is a measure of how much the tire leans toward the chassis. A wheel is said to have negative camber if the top of the wheel is leaning towards the chassis.</p>
     <center><img  src="./img/camber.png" alt="" /></center>
     <h2 class="text-primary-emphasis">+ve Camber reduces lateral grip</h2>
     <p>So what does camber do and what are the trade-offs? When a car with zero degrees camber is in a corner both tires will lean towards the outside of the corner as the car leans causing the tires to <em>reduce</em> the size of their <em>contact patch</em> with the driving surface. As a result of reducing the contact patch area traction is reduced as shown in the first two examples in the diagram below.</p>
     <center><img  src="./img/camber-during-corners.png" alt="" /></center>
     <h2 class="text-primary-emphasis">-ve camber (too a point) gives you more lateral grip</h2>
     <p>If we add the optimal amount of negative camber then as the car leans during cornering the <em>outside</em> tire will have the maximum contact patch and thus improve traction during cornering, as shown in the last example in the diagram above. By adding negative camber the inside tire does have less contact patch and thus less traction, however the increased grip on the outside more than compensates. &nbsp;This happens because the outside tire has a much higher vertical load than the inside tire. &nbsp;The greater the vertical load a tire has the more grip it has. &nbsp;This it is most important on a road &nbsp;racing car to optimize the contact patch of the outside tire. &nbsp;Now in oval car racing they will actuall add positive camber to the inside wheels to further optimize the contact patch of the inside tire. &nbsp;They can get away with this becuase oval cars only turn one way.</p>
     <h2 class="text-primary-emphasis">Too Much Negative Camber</h2>
     <p>Like every setting discussed in this workbench, you can go too far. In other words if you add too much negative camber you will actually reduce lateral grip. &nbsp;This happens because the tire never rolls over enough to offset the negative camber, which results in less than optimal contact patch.</p>
     <h2 class="text-primary-emphasis">How to find the optimal camber</h2>
     <p>With RC cars it is a little challenging to find the optimal camber as there is so much play in our suspension components and it is difficult to detect tire temp differences between the inside and the outside of the tire. Having said that by looking at tire wear this gives you some information to help you find the optimal camber. It is much easier to detect tire wear patterns when running a new tire for the first time, because the smooth glossy surface of a new tire will remain on the areas of the tire that don't get much use.</p>
     <p>For example if the front outside tire's outside 1/3 of the tire is still glossy and the inside tire is now matt and obviously more worn, then you have too much negative camber in that tire. You should aim to achieve even wear across the entire surface of your tire. keep in mind that once you achieve that even wear your car might now be understeering or oversteering, but you should not change the camber to correct the understeer/oversteer, you should use other setting changes.</p>
     <h2 class="text-primary-emphasis">More -ve Camber Reduces Braking</h2>
     <p>When the car is going straight both tires have a diminished contact patched, which will reduce the level of grip under braking or acceleration in a straight line.</p>
     <center><img src="./img/camber-reduces-brake-accel.png" alt="" /></center>
     <p><em>Keeping in mind that you should strive to obtain maximum cornering contact patch</em> with camber settings, and then use other settings on the car to affect the understeer, oversteer balance of the car. However, if you want to use camber to affect the balance because the other settings are not really giving you the balance you want then this is how camber can be used to affect balance.</p>

           <p><em>Reducing the front tires negative camber</em> will significantly reduce an off power loose situation because in an off power situation you are transferring weight to the front wheels, so they have a greater affect on the overall balance of the car than the rear tires. This <em>can produce the opposite affect</em>, if you had more camber than optimal camber, and thus by reducing the negative camber you are actually increasing the contact patch of the tire.</p>
           <p><em>Increasing the rear negative camber</em> you will likely have a larger contact patch during cornering for the rear tires, generating more lateral grip and reducing the loose feeling of the car. <em>Too much negative camber</em> in the rear tires can reduce rear lateral grip if you go past the optimal camber.</p>

     <a href="#">back to top</a>
     <h1  class="text-primary-emphasis" >Caster</h1>
     <p><em>The biggest advantage of adding more caster is that you can run less static camber on your front wheels and thus gain some more braking power. &nbsp;With that said, let's learn about caster.</em></p>
     <p>If you were to draw a line through the two points (bottom and top) at which you attach the c-hub on your car this line defines the Caster of your car. The top attachment point is typically closer to the rear of the car than the bottom attachment point, giving you a line that leans towards the back of the car from bottom to top as shown in the following diagram.</p>
     <center><img class="square" src="./img/caster-explained.png" alt="" /></center>
     <h2 class="text-primary-emphasis">Caster helps the car Self Center</h2>
     <p>The more degrees of caster you run the more the car will self center itself while driving in a straight line. This is because the side forces acting on the wheel have more leverage the further the wheel is behind the bottom connecting point (shown as the Trail Distance in the following figure) of the c-hub.</p>
     <center><img class="square" src="./img/caster-self-center.png" alt="" /></center>
     <h2 class="text-primary-emphasis">Caster changes the Camber Dynamically of the front wheels as your turn.</h2>
     <p>As you turn the front wheels during cornering the angle of the caster affects the angle of the camber dyanmically. As your turn the front wheels, the caster causes the camber to increased negatively on the outside wheeel and decrease on the inside wheel. In fact the inside wheel often will end up witha &nbsp;positive camber. &nbsp;The greater the caster angle the greater the affect it has on the dynamic camber change. &nbsp;The more you turn the wheel the greater affect the caster has on the dynamic camber.</p>
     <h2 class="text-primary-emphasis">How does it affect the handling</h2>
     <p><em>More caster typically increases mid corner steering:</em> This is because at mid corner the car has fully rolled into the corner allowing the dynamically increased negative camber to increase the contact patch size generating more lateral grip. However, too much caster is like having too much static negative camber, which can reduce grip because your tire goes past the optimal angle and actually reduces the contact patch,</p>
     <p><em>More Caster also decreases initial turn-in:</em> This is because it decreases the contact patch on initial turn-in by adding some dynamic negative camber before the car has time to roll into the corner.</p>
     <p><em>Improves Braking:</em> When you run caster you can reduce your front static negative camber, which keeps the front tires flatter and thus have a larger contact patch under braking. As indicated in the Camber section, most setups will run less front camber than the rear, because the caster adds negative camber as you turn the car.</p>
     
     <div class="container">
       <div class="row">
         <div class="col">
           <h2 class="text-primary-emphasis">Loose Off Power</h2>
           <p>If you are loose off power from just after initial turn-in up to and including the middle of the corner, then reducing the Caster will reduce the dynamic camber gain, and in most cases reduce the amount of steering.</p>
           <p>However if your static negative camber combined with your dynamic camber gain from Caster has caused the tire to only contact the inside portion of the outside tire to the driving surface during cornering, (i.e. you have way too much camber), then decreasing caster can actually give you more steering mid corner, as it would effectively increase the contact patch.</p>
       
         </div>
         <div class="col">
           <h2 class="text-primary-emphasis">Loose On Power</h2>
           <p>Although not always, increasing the caster will give you less steering as you exit the corner for similar reasons that it gives you less steering as you enter the corner. So if you want to reduce the amount of steering as you exit a corner, you can increase the caster. However in my experience this will just cause the car to have too much steering in the middle of the corner.</p>

     <a href="#">back to top</a>
     <h1 class="text-warning">Static Toe</h1>
     <p>
         The static toe of a car applies to both the front and rear suspension.  As shown in the diagram
         below, the front tires have static toe-out and the rear tires have static toe-in when the 
         distance "A" is longer than the distance <em style="color:red">"B"</em>. The amount
         of static toe-out at the front and the amount of static stoe-in at the rear have a dramatic affect on 
         the balance of the car during cornering.
     </p>
     
     <center>
         <img  class='square' src="./img/toeExplaned.png" />
     </center>
     
     <h1>Front Static Toe Impact on Handling</h1>
     
     <p>
         Since toe affects slip angle and different tires like different amounts of slip angle to 
         achieve maximum grip, different static toe will be required for different tires.  This
         means that for some tires you will want more toe-out than other tires to achieve maximum
         lateral grip.
     </p> 
     <p>
         As a general rule of thumb the more front tire <em>toe-out</em> you run the more turn-in steering 
         you will have and the less steering you will have mid corner to corner exit.  
     </p>
     <p>	
         It then follows that less front tire </em>toe-out</em> you run the less 
         turn-in steering you will have and the more mid corner and corner exit steering 
         you will have. 
     </p>
     <p>
         As indicated above these are general rules of thumb, as the opposite can actually be true
         depending on how much static toe you are already running and the optimal slip angle for the
         tire you are running. For example lets say you are running 3 degrees front toe-out and you
         have too much steering in the middle of the corner.  Contrary to the rules of thumb above,
         if the tire you run generates its maximum grip at a small slip angle of 2 degrees,
         then reducing the front toe-out will actually increase the amount of steering.  So don't be
         lazy....experiment :)
     </p>
         
     <h1>Rear Static Toe Impact on Handling</h1>
     <p>
         The <em>more rear tire toe-in you run the less steering your car will have</em>.
         Running static toe-in on the rear of the car the rear outside tire has a greater
         slip angle compared to no static rear toe-in.  This gives the outer more grip
         due to the higher slip angle. Since the outside tires contribute significantly more
         to the lateral grip of your car, more rear toe makes the car have less steering.
     </p>
     <p>
         Keep in mind that the more rear toe in you run on your car, the larger thee slip angle will be
         causing the rear tires to heat up more.  <em>Too much heat in the rear tires  may
         cause you to loose rear grip later in the race.</em> 
     </p>
     <p>
         Since a tire has an optimal slip angle at a certain load on the tire to generate maximum grip
         <em>you should experiment with different rear toe-in depending on the tires</em> you are running to achieve
         the car balance you are looking for.
     </p>
     
     <h1>Not about weight transfer in this case</h1>
     <p>
         The toe settings do not cause weight transfer to affect handling.  It is one of a couple 
         of exceptions (like Ackerman), that affects handling based on the direction of the 
         tire and something called slip angle.

                   Start by increasing the rear toe-in using very small increments (see rule of thumb below). 
                   Be careful not to add too much rear toe-in, as this can cause the car to 
                   loose rear grip later in the race.
               </p>
               <p>
                   The front toe is a little more complicated depending on where you are loose off power within the
                   corner.  For example if you start to get get loose as soon as your turn into a corner
                   and the car feels very edgy, then you will want to to decrease the front toe-out. However if you don't
                   start to get loose until after the turn-in and up to the middle of the corner then increasing the 
                   front toe-out you will take away some steering mid corner (and also corner exit).

     <h2 class="text-primary-emphasis" class="text-primary-emphasis">Rule of Thumb </h2>
     <p><em>Rear Toe-in</em>  For touring cars rear toe between 2.0 and 3.5 is a good range, with 3.0
         being an excellent starting point.  If you find the car turns in nicely and is very stable, but starts
         to push mid corner this is a good time to reduce the rear toe-in slightly, perhaps 0.5 degrees, as long
         as the car remains stable. This will free up the car mid corner and give you more mid corner and corner
         exit speed.
     <p>
         Also, in general the higher the speed of the corner the less toe you will want.  This is because 
         in order to achieve maximum grip at higher speeds you will need less slip angle on the tires. 
     </p>
     <p>
         <em>Front Toe-out: </em> Since front tire toe-out makes the car feel edge 
         on turn-in but makes the car push mid corner,
         and to me neither of these are desirable, I like to run no front to-out.  
         This provides a smooth turn-in and good mid corner steering

         It seems that most of the top touring car drivers like front and rear of the car to have a similar stiffness feeling when you push 
         down on the car, maybe with the front feeling a little less stiff than the rear.
         This does not necessarily mean the springs will be the same rate because 
         front and rear springs attach to different points in the suspension which will 
         effect the stiffness of the suspension. Please refer to the  Shock mounting positions for more information on 
         how the mounting position of the shocks will affect the stiffness of the suspension.

             Shock Dampening
         </h1>
         <p>
             Shock Oil and pistons helps control through restraint, the rate at which a shock/spring
             bumps (compresses) and re-bounds. If shocks did not have any shock oil and pistons,
             the springs would react too quickly causing the car to be very difficult to drive.

             How to Control Bump and Re-bound Dampening
         </h2>
         <p>
             To make the shock bump and re-bound more slowly (ie. have more dampening) you can
             do one or multiple of the following.
         </p>
         <ul>
             <li >
                 Increasing Shock Oil thickness
             </li>
             <li >
                 Decrease Piston Hole Size
             </li>
             <li >
                 Decrease number of Piston Holes
             </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
             To make the shock bump and rebound more quickly do the opposite of the above list.
         </p>
         <p>
             <em>
                 It is important to understand that increasing rebound dampening does not mean that
                 when you build your shocks, the dampener comes out on its own without any spring
                 assisting it. In fact that would reduce the rebound dampening. The reason for mentioning
                 this, is that a lot of drivers I talk to have this backwards.

             Slow Dampening v.s. Fast Dampening
         </h2>
         <p>
             There are two different types of dampening, one is called
             <em>
                 slow dampening
             </em>
             and the other is called
             <em>
                 fast dampening
             </em>
             .
         </p>
         <p>
             <em>
                 Fast Dampening
             </em>
             is what happens when a tire goes over a bump and there is a very quick force put
             on the shocks.
         </p>
         <p>
             <em>
                 Slow Dampening
             </em>
             is what happens when your tuning into or out of a corner or accelerating or braking.
             the forces are not as sudden as a bump.
         </p>
         <p>
             The size of the piston hole has a larger effect on fast dampening than slow dampening,
             due to the high velocity of the shock oil. The smaller the piston hole in a fast
             Dampening scenario the more "pack" is created as the high velocity oil can't fit
             through the hole as easily as slow velocity oil, making the shock very stiff, causing
             the car to bounce more.
         </p>
         <p>
             <em>
                 To reduce this bounce effect under fast dampening, make the piston hole bigger.
             </em>
         </p>
         <p>
             But damper adjustments for
             <em>
                 balance have more to do slow dampening
             </em>
             , which occurs at turn in, and turn exit. It needs to be noted that dampers effect
             on handling is contingent upon the suspension being in some state of transition.
             Once the car takes its set (ie: in a steady state sweeping turn) the dampers have
             no affect on handling until we supply a steering input that gets the suspension moving
             again.

         <p>
             The higher the spring rate the thicker the shock oil will need to be because there
             is more spring force to overcome.
         </p>
         <p>
             Build your shocks so that when you push in the dampener it does not come out on
             it's own without the aid of a spring. The reason for this is that if the dampener
             comes out on its own then it is not really helping restrain the spring very much
             and tends to make the car feel bouncy. Also if you look at the adjustments provided
             above to correct the handling scenario, none of them require more bump and less rebound
             dampening in the same shock.

     <h1 class="text-warning">Swaybars</h1>
     <p>Swaybars are designed to reduce the amount the car leans/rolls which affects how fast the car reacts, and<em>&nbsp;the overall feel</em>. However, swaybars increase the difference in vertical load on the inside and outside tires, which actually reduces overall lateral grip.&nbsp;</p>
     <p><em>So why use swaybars if they take away lateral grip?</em></p>
     <ul>
     <li>Swaybars reduce chassis roll making the car feel more predictable and easier to drive. &nbsp;</li>
     <li>Swaybars allow you to control the balance of the car by taking away grip from one end of the car.</li>
     </ul>
     <h2 class="text-primary-emphasis" class="text-primary-emphasis">How does it work</h2>
     <p>As illustrated in the diagram below, as the car leans into the corner the swaybar connected to the outside tire's suspension arm, is pushed up causing the inside tire's suspension arm to be pushed up as well, making the car corner flatter yes, but more importantly <em>cause the outside tire to have more load than the inside tire.</em> Remember that the greater the difference in load between the outside tire and the inside tire, the less lateral grip those two tires will make. Let's understand this in more detail.</p>
     <center><img class="square" src="./img/swaybars.png" alt="" /></center>
     <p>The Lateral grip for a tire increases with weight loading, but is not linear. Increasing load on a tire by 50% may only increase lateral grip by 30%. This represents a reduction of grip efficiency. That is, if you overload one tire by reducing load on the other tire (on the same axle), the total lateral grip is reduced.</p>
     <p><em>Since the stiffer the swaybar, the greater difference in load between the inside and outside tire, then it follows that a stiffer swaybar produces less lateral grip.</em></p>
     <h2 class="text-primary-emphasis" class="text-primary-emphasis"><em>Adjustable Swaybars</em></h2>
     <p>Most car designs today allow you to adjust where the vertical swaybar link connects to the swaybar. &nbsp;As you move this connection point more inboard towards the center of the chassis, this effectively stiffens the swaybar. &nbsp;Likewise the further outboard you move this connection point the less stiff the swaybar will be.</p>
     <p>On some kits you can even adjust where the swaybar link attaches to the lower A-Arm. &nbsp;The same rules apply here. &nbsp;The more inboard that connection point is the stiffer the swaybar will be.</p>
     <p>This is an often overlooked area of adjustment, that is important to helping you find the right balance in your car.&nbsp;</p>
     <p>Note: when adjusting these connection points, make sure you are not introducing "binding" to the movement of the swaybar and its links.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <h2 class="text-primary-emphasis" class="text-primary-emphasis">Keep the swaybars balanced from left to right</h2>
     <p>It is important that your swaybars have the same affect on the left and right side of your car. If this is not done then the car will not react the same way turning left as turning right.</p>
     <p>The typical reason for this inconsistency is one side of the suspension is binding more than the other side.</p>
     <p>Another common reason for this inconsistency is the left and right sway-bar mounts. Sometimes the mounts wear out and one side provides more &ldquo;slop&rdquo; than the other side.</p>
     <p>One way to test the potential inconsistency between the resistance on the left and the right is to start by taking the wheels and shocks off of the car. Then you lift up the one arm until the other arm starts to lift up. The amount you lift up that arm before the other arm lifts up should be consistent for both sides of the car. If you lift up the left arm 3mm before the right arm starts to lift up then you should lift up the right arm 3mm before the left arm starts to lift up.</p>

     <p>Also as mentioned in the weight transfer section, and the track width section, I think that a little bit of lateral weight transfer will actually increase lateral grip. I don't have facts to back this up other than my own testing, but I think due to the weight of our RC cars and my theory that as vertical load is initially added to a tire it will actually add more lateral grip than vertical load up till a point, where it will then do the opposite,</p>

     <h1 class="text-warning">Ride Height</h1>
     <p>The ride height of the car is also another powerful way to control the handling. A 0.5mm difference in ride height is very significant.</p>
     <center><img class="square" src="./img/rideheight.png" alt="" /></center>
     <h2 class="text-primary-emphasis" class="text-primary-emphasis">Ride Height Affect on Pitch Weight Transfer</h2>
     <p>The higher the ride height of your car the higher the center of gravity. This gives the car the <em>potential to pitch forward or rearward more</em>, while under braking or acceleration respectively, before the chassis hits the ground.</p>
     <p>Obviously the front and rear spring rates and the droop determine the limit of the pitch, but if you raise the ride height you could soften the springs to allow more pitch. This would allow more overall weight transfer forward or rearward.</p>
     <p>This greater range of pitch allows the driver to affect the balance of the car more with throttle and braking control, which can be a bad thing if taken too far.</p>
     <p>Having said all of this, <em>you really don't want to raise the ride hide both front and rear beyond the minimum ride height</em> in touring cars, as this will produce less grip overall as explained below. Really <em>changing ride height is more about increasing or decreasing one end of the car to affect the balance of the car.</em> Off-road is a different story, as you need to worry about bumps etc.</p>
     <p>The formula for lateral weight transfer, as describe in the lateral weight transfer section, tells us that as you raise the CG, you increase the lateral weight transfer.</p>
     <p>Since the more lateral weight transfer you have, the less lateral grip you have due to a larger difference in load between the inside and outside tires, <em>raising the ride height will reduce lateral grip, which means you always want the ride height as low as possible to maximize lateral grip.</em></p>
     <h2 class="text-primary-emphasis" class="text-primary-emphasis">Using Ride Height to control Car Balance</h2>
     <p>Keeping in mind, the affect of ride height on lateral grip and roll center, you can use the ride height to control balance of the car.</p>
     <p>If you have a higher rear ride height and a lower front ride height, then the front will have less lateral weight transfer than the rear giving the front more lateral grip than the rear, which will help improve steering.</p>
     <p>In addition the front in this situation the front will have a lower RC and the rear will have a higher RC, which will further contribute to giving the car more steering.</p>
     <p>Lastly since the ride height at the front is lower at rest, this means that without and pitch or roll the car also has more weight over the front tires again giving it more steering.</p>
     <p><em>So for these three reasons, lowering the front ride height or raising the rear ride height will give you more steering.</em></p>

       Differentials
   </h1>
   <p>
       Differentials and spools are really all that is used in today's RC car racing. Very
       few people use a one-way, so I will not be talking about one-ways.
   </p>
   <h2 class="text-primary-emphasis" class="text-primary-emphasis">
       A Diff with Less Resistance
   </h2>
   <p>
       The less a differential resists allowing the outside tire to rotate at a different
       rate than the inside tire, the less that end of the car will slide in the corners.
       However when power is applied to that differential it will have a higher tendency
       to "diff out", which means that the power is not being applied to the rotating tires
       as strongly, meaning you won't accelerate as quickly.
   </p>
   <p>
       To produce less resistance you should use a lighter oil in a gear diff and slightly
       less tension on the ball diff.
   </p>
   <h2 class="text-primary-emphasis" class="text-primary-emphasis">
       A Diff with More Resistance
   </h2>
   <p>
       When a differential is setup to provide a lot of resistance (i.e. more locked) to
       the inside wheels rotating at a different rate than the outside wheels then the opposite
       handling characteristics will happen. You will have more forward acceleration but
       that end of the car will slide more in the corners.
   </p>
   <p>
       To produce more resistance you should use a thicker oil in a gear diff, slightly
       more tension in a ball diff or go all the way to a spool which has 100% resistance.
   </p>
   <h2 class="text-primary-emphasis" class="text-primary-emphasis">
       Example
   </h2>
   <p>
       So lets assume you have more resistance in the front differential than the rear
       differential. In this case the front will slide more than compared to running a front
       diff with less resistance. As you exit the corner and start to apply throttle you
       will have more steering and more acceleration compared to a driving with a front
       diff with less resistance. &nbsp;You might be thinking that that you would have less
       steering on power because as mentioned above, a diff with more resistance will slide
       more. &nbsp;The reason for the additional on power steering with a front diff having
       more resistance is that the front tires are accelerating more and pulling the front
       of the car in the direction they are pointed. &nbsp;
   </p>
   <h2 class="text-primary-emphasis" class="text-primary-emphasis">
       What about running a diff up front with really thick oil instead of a spool?
   </h2>
   <p>
       This seemed to be a trend over the past few years, and It does have its pros and
       cons. &nbsp;On the pro side of things, because this kind of diff does diff a little
       compared to a spool it can feel smoother to drive especially when you apply power
       exiting a corner. &nbsp;In contrast a spool can often cause a snap oversteer when
       applying power out of a corner. &nbsp;In addition, this approach will likely reduce
       the wear on the front tires are little bit during a race, which can be important
       especially on asphalt where tires wear out faster than carpet. By reducing the front
       tire wear, you car will likely be more consistent throughout the run. &nbsp;On the
       con side, you will loose a little bit of acceleration off of a corner compared to
       spool. &nbsp;Also you are adding more weight to the front of your car, which will
       change the balance of your car. &nbsp; My personal point of view, is that I prefer
       a spool in almost every circumstance, as I want that max acceleration out of the
       corner, and there are many other adjustments that can be made to reduce the on power
       steering to compensate for the additional on power steering a spool will give you.
       &nbsp;Having said that a lot of the best drivers in the world run front diffs with
       really thick oil/paste in them.

       Rule of Thumb
   </h2>
   <p>
       Most Touring cars today handle best with a front spool and a rear diff. The less
       power the car has you might want to try a front diff with more resistance than the
       rear diff, but less than a spool, as this may help improve corner speed. With today's
       17.5, 13.5 and mod motors however a spool will give you much more acceleration out
       of the corner but still give you a nice stable corner entry.
